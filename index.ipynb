    "\n",
    "**Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)** computational learning theory provides a mathematically rigorous definition of what machine learning is.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have looked into steps required in order to run machine learning algorithms including data representations, feature selection and engineering, training, prediction and evaluation of results. In this lesson, we shall provide a brief overview of a __Probably Approximately Correct__ or __PAC__ learning theory that provides a foundation for experimental settings that we have looked at so far. In essence , PAC deals with the computational aspect of machine learning. The theory helps us deal with sample complexity and associated computational complexity in order to answer an analytical question. "

    "\n",
    "> The PAC is a learning models which is characterized by __learning from examples__. \n",
    "\n",
    "In its simplest form, consider $f$ as the target function to be __learnt__, the __learner__ (the computational model) is provided with some random examples in the form of $(X,f(X))$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $X$ is a binary input instance of length $n$, and $f(X)$ is the value (boolean TRUE or FALSE) of the target function at that instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these examples, the __learner must succeed__ in deducing the target function $f$ which is expressed  as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f : [0, 1]^n → {0, 1}$$. \n",
    "\n",
    "What do we actually mean by __success__?  It should actually be any measure or a series of evaluation steps that help us find that the __algorithm meets the criteria__. Hence this approach can b shown using the model below:"

    "## Failure Probability \n",
    "\n",
    "According to PAC, there is always a small probability that the learning algorithm fails and the results produced are not accurate. One obvious reason could be that learning examples do not fully reflect the probability distribution that the examples belong to, and. i.e. This hinders l learning process seriously and target function $f$ can not be achieved. insufficient examples is something that we come across very often in machine learning discipline.  PAC Learning attempts to reduce the probability of getting such poor examples by __considering a sufficient number of examples__ for learning the required function. \n",

    "\n",
    "In PAC, we do not expect the learner to learn the __exact__ function most of the time, due to limits on available examples and noise in the data etc. We expect the learner to find a function $h$ which is very close to the desired function $f$. So we say that __$h$ approximates $f$__ , and that is function we are interested in learning. \n",

    "## How PAC relates to Machine Learning \n",
    "\n",
    "PAC uses the term 'hypothesis',whereas ML literature normally uses the term 'model'. So we have seen that Machine learning starts with some data, (xi,yi) and we want to find a hypothesis (or mode) that will, given the inputs xi return yi or something very close. More importantly given new data x̃  the model will  predict the corresponding ỹ.\n",
    "\n",
    "A model that was created using some (out of many examples) of data do not accurately reflect that data set, but can be accurate on any future data sets. The two important points are that we cannot predict new data with 100% accuracy. There is also the possibility that the one or more examples are poor and do not explain much. \n",
    "\n",
    "We present our data to the learner and let it make an attempt to learn the hypothesis function. At discrete stages ,we  then look at the error as the difference between real and hypothesis function outputs. A problem is called learnable if we can reduce this error within acceptable bounds. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "SO that is PAC. It is essentially provides theoretical and mathematical underpinning to different stages of machine learning that we have been looking at in our course. This theory justifies the need for splitting data into test and training sets. It gives a reason to tune hyper parameters as the learner is independent of the data distribution. This theory also provides grounds for the evaluation methods we have seen including RMSE, ROC, AUC etc. to ensure that our model is learning and approximating a desired function. "
